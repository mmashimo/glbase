# glbase - OpenGL Simplified Windowing Base Classes
--------------------------------------------------------------------

## Description:
-----------
glBase - OOD base-class for rapid 3D- and 2D graphics model-viewer / data-manipulator.

## Overview:
--------

Design Considerations / Intent:
There are many model-viewers for 2D-objects (such as graphs, pictures, etc.). While 3D
model-viewers are generally program-specific (such as CADs, Blender, etc.).
The libraries are thin presentation layers to be used for quick model-viewing and
data-manipulating applications - by combining either or both in one base layer.

Constructs are similar to OWL, except these objects are based on OpenGL presentation
layer. The design features include:

- Open source libraries that can be used in Linux, Windows and yet untried MacOS.
  Mingw64 is the compiler for Windows/MacOS
- 


Features (so far):

Base Object(s)

GLbase - used to keep track of all objects (with ids - not necessarily unique)
